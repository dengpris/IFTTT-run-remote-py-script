# IFTTT-run-remote-py-script
This project uses IFTTT to run Python scripts remotely.



## How it Works
- IFTTT creates a Google Assistant trigger that detects a specific passphrase
  
    > In our case, the passphrase is "join the daily sync up"
- The Py script is hosted on a web application created through Flask
- Ngrok creates a URL that points to the Flask endpoint
- IFTTT uses a Webhook to access the Ngrok URL, which then run the script

-----------------
## How to Run
1. Install dependencies
    ```
    pip install pyngrok
    pip install Flask
    pip install python-dotenv
    ```

2. Launch Ngrok:    `ngrok http [port]`
3. Launch Flask:    `flask run`
4. Create an IFTTT applet
   > Select Google Assistant as the Trigger
   
   > Select Webhook as the Action

5. In the Webhook **URL** field, enter the URL generated by Ngrok with the Flask endpoint

    `e.g. http://12345678.ngrok.io/ifttt`

6. Select application/x-www-form-urlencoded as the **Content Type**
7. Save your applet
8. Now trigger the applet by activating Google Assistant (through phone or Home)
     > "Hey Google, join the daily sync up"
